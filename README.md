## About

[Obsidian-Typora-Vue-Theme](https://github.com/ZekunC/Obsidian-Typora-Vue-Theme) (**v1.0**) is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is inspired by [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) and [Blue Topaz](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css/).

The file style is choosed  to be as similar with [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) as possible so that you can use these two kinds of software simultaneously and switch in a low-cost way.

### 4. Easily Change the Accent Color

If you also try other theme color but still remain the rest style, you *ONLY* need to set the Accent Color as what you like from `Obsidian -> Settings -> Appearance -> Accent Color`.

Some accent colors I recommend :

`#e95f59` from [Drake-light in Typora](https://github.com/liangjingkanji/DrakeTyporaTheme)

`#3884ff` from [Gitbook-Azure in Typora](https://github.com/h16nning/typora-gitbook-theme)
