## About

[Obsidian-Typora-Vue](https://github.com/ZekunC/Obsidian-Typora-Vue-Theme) is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is inspired by [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme), [obsidian_orange](https://github.com/iEchoxu/obsidian_orange) and [Blue Topaz](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css/).

This project is based on [Blue Topaz](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css/) and some code of my project is from [obsidian_orange](https://github.com/iEchoxu/obsidian_orange). Thank them very much.

The font color, font size and all style is choosed elaborately to be as similar with [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) as possible so that you can use these two kinds of software simultaneously and switch in a low-cost way.

## Preview

> The icons on folder and file title in navigation are from [obsidian_orange](https://github.com/iEchoxu/obsidian_orange/blob/main/.obsidian/snippets/iconfont.css) . You can optionally use it by downloading and moving it to your local `\.obsidian\snippets\`. I will use it in the following rest of the document.
